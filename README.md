# Embedded-C-Based-Implementation-of-Street-Light-In-Real-Time

India is one of the busiest countries in the world, especially when we speak about
road traffic. A large amount of this traffic is active after sunset, when it gets dark,
and therefore street lights need to be installed without fail on every road. This is
necessary because humans, being diurnal creatures cannot see in the dark, and need
some external assistance to see, that is provided by the street lights. The presence of
street lighting can provide safety benefits at midblock and intersection locations and
can also improve safety for pedestrians, particularly at crossing points. Now, here
arises one major concern. Traffic during the night is not continuous, and there are
instants when the street light remains switched on, even when no traffic is passing
through that road. This results in a lot of wastage of electrical energy. This problem
needs to be resolved as electricity, being one of the most versatile forms of energy,
needs to be conserved. The need for conservation of electrical energy motivated us
to work on the project, “Embedded C based Implementation of Street Light in Real
Time”, which provides a mechanism to ensure that the street light is turned on only
if a car, a person, or any other object is passing through the street. Therefore, the
smooth functioning of the street light is ensured, along with the much required
conservation of electrical energy.

This approach towards designing a street light system comprises Microcontroller AT89C51
which is a variant of 8051 microcontroller, Light Dependant Resistor (LDR), Infrared (IR)
sensor, as mentioned above. In addition to this, two LEDs (Light emitting diodes) which act
as the street lights on either side of the road and an LCD (Liquid crystal display) screen is
used. The Light Dependant Resistor is used to determine whether it is daytime or nighttime.
Whereas, the Infrared sensors determine the presence of any object which is the car in our
case. The two LEDs symbolise the street lights and the LCD screen is used to display the
status of the street light.
